## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is an app that helps owners find their favorite pets. ðŸ“¦

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Except for participating in #AndroidDevChallenge competitions, I will continue to optimize them until they are available. I hope it can help the teams and caring owners who rescue small animals. Because of time constraints, I need to attend classes during the day, so basically I only have a small amount of time to write code at night, so the current version is relatively rough, but I believe I have the ability to do it well! ðŸ’ª
